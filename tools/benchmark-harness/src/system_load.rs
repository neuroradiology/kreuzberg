//! System-load capture for benchmark measurements.
//!
//! Every [`crate::types::BenchmarkResult`] records the system load at the moment
//! it was measured. Local benchmarks share the machine with editors, browsers,
//! OS scanners, and this harness itself, so a throughput or cold-start number is
//! only comparable to another taken under similar load. Recording the load per
//! result lets the analysis layer flag high-contention outliers and verify that
//! two frameworks were measured under a comparable load profile — the
//! apples-to-apples check.
//!
//! Note: the load average includes the workload being measured, so during a
//! heavy multi-threaded extraction the numbers are expected to be high. The
//! useful signals are therefore *relative* (did framework A and framework B run
//! under similar load?) and *outlier* (was this one document measured while the
//! machine was unusually busy?), not the absolute value on its own.
